#  Computational Economics with Python and Julia

##  National University of Singapore, October 2016


Lecturer: [John Stachurski](http://johnstachurski.net/)

Support: [Matthew McKay](https://github.com/mmcky)

Economists are increasingly adopting modern open source computing environments
such as [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](http://julialang.org/)
for research and policy analysis.

This workshop will cover the basics of these two language and their use in
computational economics.  We assume that participants 
have basic programming skills but do not know either Python or Julia.  We
will provide a comparison and overview of these languanges, including set up,
installation and some useful libraries.
