#  Computational Economics with Python and Julia

##  National University of Singapore, October 2016


Lecturer: [John Stachurski](http://johnstachurski.net/)

Support: [Matthew McKay](https://github.com/mmcky)

Economists are increasingly adopting modern open source computing environments
such as [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](http://julialang.org/)
for research and policy analysis.

This workshop will cover the basics of these two languages and their use in
computational economics.  We assume that participants 
have basic programming skills but do not know either Python or Julia.  We
will provide a comparison and overview of these languanges, including set up,
installation and some useful libraries.


### Instructions


*  Before coming, please install [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) on your laptop

    * Python + the main scientific libraries
    * Free from http://continuum.io/downloads
    * Choose the Python 3.5 version
    * Make it your default Python distribution

* Install [Julia](http://julialang.org/downloads)

    * Follow instructions for your OS
    * Some extra info [here](http://julialang.org/downloads/platform.html) if you need it

Please be sure to bring your laptop to the workshop.  We will have a trouble shooting session at the start.

Please make sure that you have wireless access.
